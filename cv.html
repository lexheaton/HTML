        Summary
    </h2>

    <p>
        As a creative and energetic individual, 
        I work efficiently both on my own and in a team. 
        I am happy to bring new ideas to the table and am 
        always open to new things. I am proficient with most
        software, including adobe suite, having created 
        logos, flyers and promotional material in the past. 
        I am driven and enthusiastic, and complete all work to 
        the highest standard. I am personable and feel 
        comfortable communicating with people of all ages.
